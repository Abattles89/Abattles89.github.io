*"Why did you decide to learn software development?"*

  This question has popped up in many ways because I had filled this question with so many 
answers. There were answers that were *easily* responsive and others that were hard to 
come by (i.e.* Remember*).



So, without further ado, I will give you all a lovely back story on how became intrested
in Computer Coding and Technology:



  For many years, I have been having a knack for computers. I used to be an art geek in my
teenage years. I used to obsess over artworks paints colors and drawing styles. Until the
day I got on my Mom's computer to surf the web to find more artwork to be inspired by. Not 
only that, but then I had started to wonder how programs work:

*"How do they work with such succession?" "How do they function?" "How well do they fulfill
a simple request from a user's input?"*

These questions weren't answered completely unitl I went to college in the Spring of 2016.



This, in an unfortunate circumstance, was a horrifying year to get a better understanding on
what computer coding really is.


    
On my first day of class, I was more excited to be prepared to fulfilly my untimate dream to write
code and do some magic tricks on the computer. It was fun and the most enjoyable day I've ever 
had, until I had accidentally got on my instructor's bad side. 

   
 When I had had written the wrong code into the computer's console, He became irate. It was
terrifying. He berated me over the slightese and most unfortunate mistake I didn't even know 
about and it made me feel much less of a person. It had happened so often that it tore me apart 
psychologically.It was so scary and traumatic that I had to put my dreams of being a software
engineer on hold for about 3 years. Not only did the incident cause a mental shutdown of my 
journey to being a computer programmer (a.k.a. Software Engineer), family problems and extreme
heartbreak exacerbated my mental health altogether.


3 years had passed and I had moved to Texas the in the summer of 2017. It was the year that 
changed everything. My mental health was becoming stabilized and I have eventually recovered
from my trauma that happened to me long ago.

 It wasn't until the Fall of 2019, I had noticed an ad on Instagram about an opportunity to become 
a Software Engineer. It was Career Karma. I was intrigued at first, but I was more focused on my 
work and what need to be done over there. A couple of weeks later, after seing the exact 
same Career Karma ads repeatedly, I relented and downloaded their app. 


Days later, I got an email for the CEO of Career Karma informing me about an upcoming interview.
I was so surprised on how quick they were to respond to my information request. Nonetheless, I was 
excited to restart my ultimate dream of becoming a Software Engineer. After finishing many interviews, 
completing the 21-day challenge, Meeting with Job Counselors and interacting with like-minded souls,
I happily and excitedly settled with Flatiron School.



That's my special backstory about my ongoing journey of becoming a Software Engineer. I feel right
at home and feel treated alot better than what i had experienced in college years prior.


No irate instructors, no cruelty. Just like-minded souls who will help each with every assignment no matter how complex the assignment may be.


I'll see you again soon!
